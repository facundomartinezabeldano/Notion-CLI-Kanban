I've been using a Kanban on Notion ever since I needed to write down tasks for my every day life, but I couldn't stop thinking that sometimes I missed things just because I was too lazy to just open up notion, write down the thing I needed to do, and in case of doing it updating the Kanban accordingly, that's why I made this little silly CLI interface for my notion notes, feel free to try it your own

  <h3>Why using a CLI instead of the GUI?</h3>
    <p>To which I add... why not using both? that's what this CLI is pointing to you can still use the Kanban layout of this repository in Notion actually that's something I promote but this aims to reduce the toiling of opening the browser on your own and doing manually </p>
